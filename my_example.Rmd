# Load and Graph Data
Here we load the entire data and then filtered it to show only for the year 1992:

```{r loading-library, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

gapminder <- read.csv("data/gapminder.csv")
gapminder_1992 <- gapminder %>% filter(year == 1992)
```

Here we plotted the graph from the gapminder for the year 1992:

```{r plot-graph}
ggplot(gapminder_1992, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) + 
  geom_point()
```
